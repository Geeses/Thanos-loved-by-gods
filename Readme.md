#### Thanos, loved by God
## Summary
ItÂ´s a game started by 13 students at the University of Applied Sciences in Mittweida in Germany. The original repository can be found here:
https://bitbucket.org/Saki-chan/gdd2/src/master/
This repository contains additional work, and changes made by me (Andre Spittel) and my friends Albina Hironymus (Art) and Oliver Wobst (Animation).

The game is a 2D Couch Coop Jump'n'Run, where you can play 2 different characters: the ancient god Zeus, or the scared greek soldier Thanos. Zeus lost his amulet of power and it fell somewhere into the world of mortals. The minions of Hades saw this accident and are trying to find this amulet themselves. Can you find it?
